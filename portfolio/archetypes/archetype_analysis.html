<p>The generalised purpose of Archetypes in media are fundamental for a powerful character as they appear across storytelling and game design while also being seen in media like films and TV.
    <br>The exercise has developed my ability to identify and analyse how archetypes shape the overall character and nature portrayed.
    <br>Understanding archetypes help me be able to create more compelling and relatable characters by using patterns that will be instantly recognised by players.
    <br>The key concepts include the Hero’s Journey, character roles, and how visual design reinforces archetypal traits.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the first exercise, I used the character that I selected and examined what Archetypes the character would follow.
    <br>Alongside this, I also examined how both the character and their archetypes would contribute to the games overall narrative. </p>
